WARNING 1 [file grompp.mdp, line 342]:
  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used

WARNING 2 [file grompp.mdp]:
  The sum of the two largest charge group radii (0.208298) is larger than
  rlist (1.000000) - rvdw (0.850000).
  With exact cut-offs, better performance can be obtained with
  cutoff-scheme = Verlet, because it does not use charge groups at all.
