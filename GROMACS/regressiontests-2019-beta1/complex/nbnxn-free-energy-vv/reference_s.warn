WARNING 1 [file ./grompp.mdp, line 351]:
  You are using soft-core interactions while the Van der Waals interactions
  are not decoupled (note that the sc-coul option is only active when using
  lambda states). Although this will not lead to errors, you will need much
  more sampling than without soft-core interactions. Consider using
  sc-alpha=0.

WARNING 2 [file topol.top, line 48]:
  Some parameters for bonded interaction involving perturbed atoms are
  specified explicitly in state A, but not B - copying A to B
