The gromacs-2016.3, regressiontests-2016.3, and documentation
subdirectories contain, respectively, the source code of the GROMACS
2016.3 release, the regression tests suite, and the matching
documentation generated from the source.

Further information, licensing information, and details for the
install process can be found in the gromacs-2016.3 subdirectory, in
respectively the README, COPYING and INSTALL files.

The documentation is identical to that found at
http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2016.3/ and best viewed with a
web browser, beginning at documentation/index.html.

The regressiontests suite is intended to be used for automatically
testing a build of GROMACS. Detailed instructions are found in the
install guide.

The pmx subdirectory contains the pmx package of topology setup and
analysis scripts useful for free-energy calculations with GROMACS.  It
was obtained from commit 5fb5781 of https://github.com/dseeliger/pmx
and forms the basis of the web service
http://pmx.mpibpc.mpg.de/webserver.html. It functions as a standalone
python package (with several readily available dependencies, including
GROMACS) for the convenience of users with larger-scale needs than can
be satisifed by the web service. Its README.md and LICENSE files
have further information.
