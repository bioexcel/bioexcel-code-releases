NMR distance restraints with multiple pairs

NMR distance restraints are more complex than other bonded interactions
as they can have (and do have in this test) multiple pairs per restraint.
This requires a two step calculation process with communication.
This test checks the computation of the violation energy and sum of
violations and should be run with both MPI and OpenMP parallelization.
Note that it does not use time averaging, since it is not supported
with MPI (and probably obsolete anyhow, as ensemble averaging is preferred).
Note that it does not write distance restraint pair output, as that
is not supported with MPI.
