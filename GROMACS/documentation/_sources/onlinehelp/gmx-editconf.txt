Description
-----------

``gmx editconf`` converts generic structure format to :ref:`.gro <gro>`, ``.g96``
or :ref:`.pdb <pdb>`.

The box can be modified with options ``-box``, ``-d`` and
``-angles``. Both ``-box`` and ``-d``
will center the system in the box, unless ``-noc`` is used.

Option ``-bt`` determines the box type: ``triclinic`` is a
triclinic box, ``cubic`` is a rectangular box with all sides equal
``dodecahedron`` represents a rhombic dodecahedron and
``octahedron`` is a truncated octahedron.
The last two are special cases of a triclinic box.
The length of the three box vectors of the truncated octahedron is the
shortest distance between two opposite hexagons.
Relative to a cubic box with some periodic image distance, the volume of a
dodecahedron with this same periodic distance is 0.71 times that of the cube,
and that of a truncated octahedron is 0.77 times.

Option ``-box`` requires only
one value for a cubic, rhombic dodecahedral, or truncated octahedral box.

With ``-d`` and a ``triclinic`` box the size of the system in the *x*-, *y*-,
and *z*-directions is used. With ``-d`` and ``cubic``,
``dodecahedron`` or ``octahedron`` boxes, the dimensions are set
to the diameter of the system (largest distance between atoms) plus twice
the specified distance.

Option ``-angles`` is only meaningful with option ``-box`` and
a triclinic box and cannot be used with option ``-d``.

When ``-n`` or ``-ndef`` is set, a group
can be selected for calculating the size and the geometric center,
otherwise the whole system is used.

``-rotate`` rotates the coordinates and velocities.

``-princ`` aligns the principal axes of the system along the
coordinate axes, with the longest axis aligned with the *x*-axis.
This may allow you to decrease the box volume,
but beware that molecules can rotate significantly in a nanosecond.

Scaling is applied before any of the other operations are
performed. Boxes and coordinates can be scaled to give a certain density (option
``-density``). Note that this may be inaccurate in case a :ref:`.gro <gro>`
file is given as input. A special feature of the scaling option is that when the
factor -1 is given in one dimension, one obtains a mirror image,
mirrored in one of the planes. When one uses -1 in three dimensions,
a point-mirror image is obtained.

Groups are selected after all operations have been applied.

Periodicity can be removed in a crude manner.
It is important that the box vectors at the bottom of your input file
are correct when the periodicity is to be removed.

When writing :ref:`.pdb <pdb>` files, B-factors can be
added with the ``-bf`` option. B-factors are read
from a file with with following format: first line states number of
entries in the file, next lines state an index
followed by a B-factor. The B-factors will be attached per residue
unless the number of B-factors is larger than the number of the residues or unless the
``-atom`` option is set. Obviously, any type of numeric data can
be added instead of B-factors. ``-legend`` will produce
a row of CA atoms with B-factors ranging from the minimum to the
maximum value found, effectively making a legend for viewing.

With the option ``-mead`` a special :ref:`.pdb <pdb>` (.pqr)
file for the MEAD electrostatics
program (Poisson-Boltzmann solver) can be made. A further prerequisite
is that the input file is a run input file.
The B-factor field is then filled with the Van der Waals radius
of the atoms while the occupancy field will hold the charge.

The option ``-grasp`` is similar, but it puts the charges in the B-factor
and the radius in the occupancy.

Option ``-align`` allows alignment
of the principal axis of a specified group against the given vector,
with an optional center of rotation specified by ``-aligncenter``.

Finally, with option ``-label``, ``editconf`` can add a chain identifier
to a :ref:`.pdb <pdb>` file, which can be useful for analysis with e.g. Rasmol.

To convert a truncated octrahedron file produced by a package which uses
a cubic box with the corners cut off (such as GROMOS), use::

  gmx editconf -f in -rotate 0 45 35.264 -bt o -box veclen -o out

where ``veclen`` is the size of the cubic box times sqrt(3)/2.

Known Issues
------------

* For complex molecules, the periodicity removal routine may break down, in that case you can use :doc:`gmx trjconv <gmx-trjconv>`.
