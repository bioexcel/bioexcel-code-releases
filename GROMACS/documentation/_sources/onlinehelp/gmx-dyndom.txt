               [:strong:`-maxangle` :emphasis:`<real>`] [:strong:`-trans` :emphasis:`<real>`] [:strong:`-head` :emphasis:`<vector>`]
               [:strong:`-tail` :emphasis:`<vector>`]

Description
-----------

``gmx dyndom`` reads a :ref:`.pdb <pdb>` file output from DynDom
(http://www.cmp.uea.ac.uk/dyndom/).
It reads the coordinates, the coordinates of the rotation axis,
and an index file containing the domains.
Furthermore, it takes the first and last atom of the arrow file
as command line arguments (head and tail) and
finally it takes the translation vector (given in DynDom info file)
and the angle of rotation (also as command line arguments). If the angle
determined by DynDom is given, one should be able to recover the
second structure used for generating the DynDom output.
Because of limited numerical accuracy this should be verified by
computing an all-atom RMSD (using :doc:`gmx confrms <gmx-confrms>`) rather than by file
comparison (using diff).

The purpose of this program is to interpolate and extrapolate the
rotation as found by DynDom. As a result unphysical structures with
long or short bonds, or overlapping atoms may be produced. Visual
inspection, and energy minimization may be necessary to
validate the structure.
