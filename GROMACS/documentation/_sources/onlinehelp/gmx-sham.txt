Description
-----------

``gmx sham`` makes multi-dimensional free-energy, enthalpy and entropy plots.
``gmx sham`` reads one or more :ref:`.xvg <xvg>` files and analyzes data sets.
The basic purpose of ``gmx sham`` is to plot Gibbs free energy landscapes
(option ``-ls``)
by Bolzmann inverting multi-dimensional histograms (option ``-lp``),
but it can also
make enthalpy (option ``-lsh``) and entropy (option ``-lss``)
plots. The histograms can be made for any quantities the user supplies.
A line in the input file may start with a time
(see option ``-time``) and any number of *y*-values may follow.
Multiple sets can also be
read when they are separated by & (option ``-n``),
in this case only one *y*-value is read from each line.
All lines starting with # and @ are skipped.

Option ``-ge`` can be used to supply a file with free energies
when the ensemble is not a Boltzmann ensemble, but needs to be biased
by this free energy. One free energy value is required for each
(multi-dimensional) data point in the ``-f`` input.

Option ``-ene`` can be used to supply a file with energies.
These energies are used as a weighting function in the single
histogram analysis method by Kumar et al. When temperatures
are supplied (as a second column in the file), an experimental
weighting scheme is applied. In addition the vales
are used for making enthalpy and entropy plots.

With option ``-dim``, dimensions can be gives for distances.
When a distance is 2- or 3-dimensional, the circumference or surface
sampled by two particles increases with increasing distance.
Depending on what one would like to show, one can choose to correct
the histogram and free-energy for this volume effect.
The probability is normalized by r and r^2 for dimensions of 2 and 3,
respectively.
A value of -1 is used to indicate an angle in degrees between two
vectors: a sin(angle) normalization will be applied.
**Note** that for angles between vectors the inner-product or cosine
is the natural quantity to use, as it will produce bins of the same
volume.
