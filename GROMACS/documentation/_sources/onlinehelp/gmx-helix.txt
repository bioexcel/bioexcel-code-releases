Description
-----------

``gmx helix`` computes all kinds of helix properties. First, the peptide
is checked to find the longest helical part, as determined by
hydrogen bonds and phi/psi angles.
That bit is fitted
to an ideal helix around the *z*-axis and centered around the origin.
Then the following properties are computed:

 * Helix radius (file ``radius.xvg``). This is merely the
   RMS deviation in two dimensions for all Calpha atoms.
   it is calculated as sqrt((sum_i (x^2(i)+y^2(i)))/N) where N is the number
   of backbone atoms. For an ideal helix the radius is 0.23 nm.
 * Twist (file ``twist.xvg``). The average helical angle per
   residue is calculated. For an alpha-helix it is 100 degrees,
   for 3-10 helices it will be smaller, and
   for 5-helices it will be larger.
 * Rise per residue (file ``rise.xvg``). The helical rise per
   residue is plotted as the difference in *z*-coordinate between Calpha
   atoms. For an ideal helix, this is 0.15 nm.
 * Total helix length (file ``len-ahx.xvg``). The total length
   of the
   helix in nm. This is simply the average rise (see above) times the
   number of helical residues (see below).
 * Helix dipole, backbone only (file ``dip-ahx.xvg``).
 * RMS deviation from ideal helix, calculated for the Calpha
   atoms only (file ``rms-ahx.xvg``).
 * Average Calpha - Calpha dihedral angle (file ``phi-ahx.xvg``).
 * Average phi and psi angles (file ``phipsi.xvg``).
 * Ellipticity at 222 nm according to Hirst and Brooks.
