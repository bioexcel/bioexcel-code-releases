Description
-----------

``gmx spol`` analyzes dipoles around a solute; it is especially useful
for polarizable water. A group of reference atoms, or a center
of mass reference (option ``-com``) and a group of solvent
atoms is required. The program splits the group of solvent atoms
into molecules. For each solvent molecule the distance to the
closest atom in reference group or to the COM is determined.
A cumulative distribution of these distances is plotted.
For each distance between ``-rmin`` and ``-rmax``
the inner product of the distance vector
and the dipole of the solvent molecule is determined.
For solvent molecules with net charge (ions), the net charge of the ion
is subtracted evenly from all atoms in the selection of each ion.
The average of these dipole components is printed.
The same is done for the polarization, where the average dipole is
subtracted from the instantaneous dipole. The magnitude of the average
dipole is set with the option ``-dip``, the direction is defined
by the vector from the first atom in the selected solvent group
to the midpoint between the second and the third atom.
