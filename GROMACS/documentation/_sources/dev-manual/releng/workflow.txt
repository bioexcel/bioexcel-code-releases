Workflow build overview
=======================

.. _releng-workflow-matrix-launcher:

Matrix build launcher
---------------------

The workflow build in :file:`matrix-launcher.groovy` is a relatively simple
workflow where the actual build is performed by a normal matrix build.  The
workflow does these things:

1. The workflow does a normal git checkout to show Changes and other git data
   on the build page.  This happens in the initial node context where the
   workflow script is loaded.
2. Also in the initial node context, the Jenkins job calls
   ``loadMatrixConfigs()`` and passes the name of the matrix to use.  The
   workflow build calls ``prepare_multi_configuration_build()`` Python
   function, and reads the build axis into a local variable.
3. The Jenkins job calls ``doBuild()`` with the name of the matrix build to
   trigger.  The workflow triggers the matrix job, forwarding all relevant build
   parameters to it, and adding the build configuration axis as an additional
   parameter.
4. After the matrix build finishes, the workflow adds a link to the matrix
   build to the build summary page (while the build is running, the link can be
   found from the console log).  The build status of the matrix build is also
   propagated to the status of the workflow job.
5. Also, as the last step in the workflow, it sets the URL to post back to
   Gerrit to point to the matrix build.  This means that the presence of this
   launcher job is mostly invisible during normal usage.  Only if the workflow
   itself fails before reaching this step, you actually see a link to the
   launcher job in Gerrit.

Clang static analysis
---------------------

The workflow build in :file:`clang-analyzer.groovy` is a simple workflow that
performs static analysis using Clang.  The main reason for using a workflow
build instead of a freestyle job is to make it easy to dynamically decide the
node where the analysis runs, depending on which version of the analyzer should
be used.  The workflow sequence is this:

1. The workflow does a normal git checkout to show Changes and other git data
   on the build page.  This happens in the initial node context where the
   workflow script is loaded.
2. Also in the initial node context, the workflow calls
   ``read_build_script_config()`` Python function to get the build options
   defined in the :file:`clang-analyzer.py` build script in the source repo.
   This is stored in a local variable.
3. The Jenkins job calls ``doBuild()`` without parameters.
   The workflow allocates a node based on the build options, and
   runs the :file:`clang-analyzer.py` build script there with releng.
4. After the releng script finishes, the workflow publishes a HTML report
   produced by the analyzer (if it exists), and scans for compiler warnings
   from the console log to show them on the build page.

.. _releng-workflow-release:

Build & test release tarballs
-----------------------------

The workflow build in :file:`release.groovy` is a more complex worflow that
coordinates the building and testing of the tarballs for a release.
The packaging of the tarballs is handled by two separate, non-workflow Jenkins
jobs, one for the source code and one for the regressiontests.
The general sequence is this:

1. The workflow reads the refspecs to use for the build from build parameters,
   and does some preparatory steps.  It also reads a set of configurations to
   test from :file:`release-matrix.txt` in the source repo, using
   ``prepare_multi_configuration_build()`` Python function, and reads the
   configuration into a data structure.  It also extracts version information
   from the source repository (using :file:`get-version-info.py` build script),
   since the regressiontests repository does not contain this.
2. The workflow checks the latest successful builds in the packaging builds,
   and if these are not built from the correct commit, it triggers new builds
   for them.  The regressiontests tarball is built first, and its MD5 sum is
   checked against the one specified in the source tarball.  For a `RELEASE`
   build, a mismatch fails the build, otherwise it only produces a note in the
   console output.
   The packaging builds also compute MD5 sums for the tarballs, and these are
   accessible from Jenkins.
3. After the tarballs are available, the workflow runs each configuration
   from the test matrix in parallel, using ``run_build()``, and the standard
   :file:`gromacs.py` build script from the source tarball.
   A summary is posted to the build summary page (for each configuration, on
   which host it was built and whether it was successful, unstable, or failed),
   but compiler warnings etc.  are currently only available from the console
   log (available for a single configuration with some browsing under "Pipeline
   Steps").
4. If all tests passed, the workflow then does a final documentation build from
   the source tarball, which will produce the HTML pages for the documentation
   website.  The generated pages are available from the Jenkins project page,
   as well as from a link on the build summary page.
   If the `RELEASE` build parameter is set, a tarball containing all the
   documentation is also archived as an artifact.

In addition to the refspecs to build, the workflow uses two additional build
parameters:

RELEASE
  If set, the ``-dev`` suffix is stripped from all the tarballs, and from
  content within them.
  Note that currently, the ``-dev`` suffixes never appear in the generated
  website, irrespective of this
FORCE_REPACKAGING
  If set, the tarballs are rebuilt, even if ones built from the correct
  refspecs and with the same value of ``RELEASE`` is available.
  This is useful if only releng or Jenkins configuration has changed in a way
  that influences the tarballs.

The workflow and the level of testing is still a work-in-progress, but it
already covers most of what the earlier builds did, and remaining content
should not be too hard to add.  Missing functionality is indicated with TODOs
in the workflow script or in the build scripts in the source repo.

On-demand launcher
------------------

The workflow build in :file:`ondemand.groovy` handles builds that are triggered
with a ``[JENKINS]`` comment from Gerrit.  The actual builds are done using
separate, non-workflow jobs triggered from the workflow.
The general sequence is:

1. In the context of the initial checkout, the workflow uses
   ``get_actions_from_triggering_comment()`` to parse the comment from Gerrit.
   This function will also read information from the ``gromacs`` repository,
   e.g., to fill out the matrix options into the returned data structure.
2. In the same context, the workflow does a normal git checkout to show Changes
   and other git data on the build page.
3. The Jenkins job calls ``doBuild()`` without parameters.  The workflow runs
   the requested builds in parallel, based on the data structure it got in
   step 1.  All relevant build parameters are forwarded.  Some actions are
   handled directly within the workflow instead of triggering a separate build.
4. After the builds finish, the workflow adds links to the triggered builds
   to the build summary page (while the build is running, the link can be found
   from the console log).  The workflow then uses ``do_ondemand_post_build()``
   to construct the message to post back to Gerrit, as well as to perform other
   actions such as posting cross-verify messages.  The combined build status of
   the builds is also propagated to the status of the workflow job.
