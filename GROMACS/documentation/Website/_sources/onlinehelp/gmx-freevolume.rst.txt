Description
-----------

``gmx freevolume`` calculates the free volume in a box as
a function of time. The free volume is
plotted as a fraction of the total volume.
The program tries to insert a probe with a given radius,
into the simulations box and if the distance between the
probe and any atom is less than the sums of the
van der Waals radii of both atoms, the position is
considered to be occupied, i.e. non-free. By using a
probe radius of 0, the true free volume is computed.
By using a larger radius, e.g. 0.14 nm, roughly corresponding
to a water molecule, the free volume for a hypothetical
particle with that size will be produced.
Note however, that since atoms are treated as hard-spheres
these number are very approximate, and typically only
relative changes are meaningful, for instance by doing a
series of simulations at different temperature.

The group specified by the selection is considered to
delineate non-free volume.
The number of insertions per unit of volume is important
to get a converged result. About 1000/nm^3 yields an overall
standard deviation that is determined by the fluctuations in
the trajectory rather than by the fluctuations due to the
random numbers.

The results are critically dependent on the van der Waals radii;
we recommend to use the values due to Bondi (1964).

The Fractional Free Volume (FFV) that some authors like to use
is given by 1 - 1.3*(1-Free Volume). This value is printed on
the terminal.
