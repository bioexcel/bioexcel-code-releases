Description
-----------

``gmx gangle`` computes different types of angles between vectors.
It supports both vectors defined by two positions and normals of
planes defined by three positions.
The z axis or the local normal of a sphere can also be used as
one of the vectors.
There are also convenience options 'angle' and 'dihedral' for
calculating bond angles and dihedrals defined by three/four
positions.

The type of the angle is specified with ``-g1`` and ``-g2``.
If ``-g1`` is ``angle`` or ``dihedral``, ``-g2``
should not be specified.
In this case, ``-group1`` should specify one or more selections,
and each should contain triplets or quartets of positions that define
the angles to be calculated.

If ``-g1`` is ``vector`` or ``plane``, ``-group1``
should specify selections that contain either pairs (``vector``)
or triplets (``plane``) of positions. For vectors, the positions
set the endpoints of the vector, and for planes, the three positions
are used to calculate the normal of the plane. In both cases,
``-g2`` specifies the other vector to use (see below).

With ``-g2 vector`` or ``-g2 plane``, ``-group2`` should
specify another set of vectors. ``-group1`` and ``-group2``
should specify the same number of selections. It is also allowed to
only have a single selection for one of the options, in which case
the same selection is used with each selection in the other group.
Similarly, for each selection in ``-group1``, the corresponding
selection in ``-group2`` should specify the same number of
vectors or a single vector. In the latter case, the angle is
calculated between that single vector and each vector from the other
selection.

With ``-g2 sphnorm``, each selection in ``-group2`` should
specify a single position that is the center of the sphere.
The second vector is calculated as the vector from the center to the
midpoint of the positions specified by ``-group1``.

With ``-g2 z``, ``-group2`` is not necessary, and angles
between the first vectors and the positive Z axis are calculated.

With ``-g2 t0``, ``-group2`` is not necessary, and angles
are calculated from the vectors as they are in the first frame.

There are three options for output:
``-oav`` writes an xvg file with the time and the average angle
for each frame.
``-oall`` writes all the individual angles.
``-oh`` writes a histogram of the angles. The bin width can be
set with ``-binw``.
For ``-oav`` and ``-oh``, separate average/histogram is
computed for each selection in ``-group1``.
