Description
-----------

``gmx mdrun`` is the main computational chemistry engine
within GROMACS. Obviously, it performs Molecular Dynamics simulations,
but it can also perform Stochastic Dynamics, Energy Minimization,
test particle insertion or (re)calculation of energies.
Normal mode analysis is another option. In this case ``mdrun``
builds a Hessian matrix from single conformation.
For usual Normal Modes-like calculations, make sure that
the structure provided is properly energy-minimized.
The generated matrix can be diagonalized by :doc:`gmx nmeig <gmx-nmeig>`.

The ``mdrun`` program reads the run input file (``-s``)
and distributes the topology over ranks if needed.
``mdrun`` produces at least four output files.
A single log file (``-g``) is written.
The trajectory file (``-o``), contains coordinates, velocities and
optionally forces.
The structure file (``-c``) contains the coordinates and
velocities of the last step.
The energy file (``-e``) contains energies, the temperature,
pressure, etc, a lot of these things are also printed in the log file.
Optionally coordinates can be written to a compressed trajectory file
(``-x``).

The option ``-dhdl`` is only used when free energy calculation is
turned on.

Running mdrun efficiently in parallel is a complex topic topic,
many aspects of which are covered in the online User Guide. You
should look there for practical advice on using many of the options
available in mdrun.

ED (essential dynamics) sampling and/or additional flooding potentials
are switched on by using the ``-ei`` flag followed by an :ref:`.edi <edi>`
file. The :ref:`.edi <edi>` file can be produced with the ``make_edi`` tool
or by using options in the essdyn menu of the WHAT IF program.
``mdrun`` produces a :ref:`.xvg <xvg>` output file that
contains projections of positions, velocities and forces onto selected
eigenvectors.

When user-defined potential functions have been selected in the
:ref:`.mdp <mdp>` file the ``-table`` option is used to pass ``mdrun``
a formatted table with potential functions. The file is read from
either the current directory or from the ``GMXLIB`` directory.
A number of pre-formatted tables are presented in the ``GMXLIB`` dir,
for 6-8, 6-9, 6-10, 6-11, 6-12 Lennard-Jones potentials with
normal Coulomb.
When pair interactions are present, a separate table for pair interaction
functions is read using the ``-tablep`` option.

When tabulated bonded functions are present in the topology,
interaction functions are read using the ``-tableb`` option.
For each different tabulated interaction type used, a table file name must
be given. For the topology to work, a file name given here must match a
character sequence before the file extension. That sequence is: an underscore,
then a 'b' for bonds, an 'a' for angles or a 'd' for dihedrals,
and finally the matching table number index used in the topology.

The options ``-px`` and ``-pf`` are used for writing pull COM
coordinates and forces when pulling is selected
in the :ref:`.mdp <mdp>` file.

Finally some experimental algorithms can be tested when the
appropriate options have been given. Currently under
investigation are: polarizability.

The option ``-membed`` does what used to be g_membed, i.e. embed
a protein into a membrane. This module requires a number of settings
that are provided in a data file that is the argument of this option.
For more details in membrane embedding, see the documentation in the
user guide. The options ``-mn`` and ``-mp`` are used to provide
the index and topology files used for the embedding.

The option ``-pforce`` is useful when you suspect a simulation
crashes due to too large forces. With this option coordinates and
forces of atoms with a force larger than a certain value will
be printed to stderr. It will also terminate the run when non-finite
forces are present.

Checkpoints containing the complete state of the system are written
at regular intervals (option ``-cpt``) to the file ``-cpo``,
unless option ``-cpt`` is set to -1.
The previous checkpoint is backed up to ``state_prev.cpt`` to
make sure that a recent state of the system is always available,
even when the simulation is terminated while writing a checkpoint.
With ``-cpnum`` all checkpoint files are kept and appended
with the step number.
A simulation can be continued by reading the full state from file
with option ``-cpi``. This option is intelligent in the way that
if no checkpoint file is found, GROMACS just assumes a normal run and
starts from the first step of the :ref:`.tpr <tpr>` file. By default the output
will be appending to the existing output files. The checkpoint file
contains checksums of all output files, such that you will never
loose data when some output files are modified, corrupt or removed.
There are three scenarios with ``-cpi``:

``*`` no files with matching names are present: new output files are written

``*`` all files are present with names and checksums matching those stored
in the checkpoint file: files are appended

``*`` otherwise no files are modified and a fatal error is generated

With ``-noappend`` new output files are opened and the simulation
part number is added to all output file names.
Note that in all cases the checkpoint file itself is not renamed
and will be overwritten, unless its name does not match
the ``-cpo`` option.

With checkpointing the output is appended to previously written
output files, unless ``-noappend`` is used or none of the previous
output files are present (except for the checkpoint file).
The integrity of the files to be appended is verified using checksums
which are stored in the checkpoint file. This ensures that output can
not be mixed up or corrupted due to file appending. When only some
of the previous output files are present, a fatal error is generated
and no old output files are modified and no new output files are opened.
The result with appending will be the same as from a single run.
The contents will be binary identical, unless you use a different number
of ranks or dynamic load balancing or the FFT library uses optimizations
through timing.

With option ``-maxh`` a simulation is terminated and a checkpoint
file is written at the first neighbor search step where the run time
exceeds ``-maxh``\*0.99 hours. This option is particularly useful in
combination with setting ``nsteps`` to -1 either in the mdp or using the
similarly named command line option. This results in an infinite run,
terminated only when the time limit set by ``-maxh`` is reached (if any)or upon receiving a signal.

When ``mdrun`` receives a TERM or INT signal (e.g. when ctrl+C is
pressed), it will stop at the next neighbor search step or at the
second global communication step, whichever happens later.
When ``mdrun`` receives a second TERM or INT signal and
reproducibility is not requested, it will stop at the first global
communication step.
In both cases all the usual output will be written to file and
a checkpoint file is written at the last step.
When ``mdrun`` receives an ABRT signal or the third TERM or INT signal,
it will abort directly without writing a new checkpoint file.
When running with MPI, a signal to one of the ``mdrun`` ranks
is sufficient, this signal should not be sent to mpirun or
the ``mdrun`` process that is the parent of the others.

Interactive molecular dynamics (IMD) can be activated by using at least one
of the three IMD switches: The ``-imdterm`` switch allows one to terminate
the simulation from the molecular viewer (e.g. VMD). With ``-imdwait``,
``mdrun`` pauses whenever no IMD client is connected. Pulling from the
IMD remote can be turned on by ``-imdpull``.
The port ``mdrun`` listens to can be altered by ``-imdport``.The
file pointed to by ``-if`` contains atom indices and forces if IMD
pulling is used.

When ``mdrun`` is started with MPI, it does not run niced by default.
