Description
-----------

|Gromacs| is a full-featured suite of programs to perform molecular
dynamics simulations, i.e., to simulate the behavior of systems with
hundreds to millions of particles using Newtonian equations of motion.
It is primarily used for research on proteins, lipids, and polymers, but
can be applied to a wide variety of chemical and biological research
questions.
