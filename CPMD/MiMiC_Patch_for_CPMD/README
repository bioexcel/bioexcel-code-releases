In order to compile CPMD with MiMiC interface:

- Install GROMACS 2019 or later with MiMiC enabled features as documented in the GROMACS manual

- Compile the MiMiC Communication Library MiMiC_CommLib.tar.gz in this archive following the following strategy:

cd MiMiCCommLib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_location> ..
make && make install
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<install_location>:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
cd ../.. 

- Download and expand the file cpmd-v4.1.tar.gz that you can download from the CPMD.org website after registering:

tar -xvzf cpmd-v4.1.tar.gz

- Copy the patch MiMiC_Patch_for_CPMD-4.1.txt in this archive to the folder CPMD:

cd CPMD
cp ../MiMiC_Patch_for_CPMD-4.1.txt .
patch -p1 < MiMiC_Patch_for_CPMD-4.1.txt

- In the folder “configure” open the file MIMIC (if compiling with GCC compiler) or MIMIC_INTEL (if compiling with INTEL compiler) and adjust the paths for LIBS and FFLAGS in order to point to MimicCommLib and MiMiC build folders

- Compile CPMD by following the detailed instructions in the CPMD manual, or for a default compilation by executing the command:

./configure.sh MIMIC<_INTEL> -omp (if you want to use also OPENMP threads)
make

- After the compilation the executable will be named cpmd.x
