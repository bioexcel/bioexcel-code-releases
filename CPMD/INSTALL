In order to compile CPMD with MiMiC interface:

- Install GROMACS 2019 or later with MiMiC enabled features, as
  documented in the GROMACS installation guide. Building QM/MM-capable
  version requires double-precision version of GROMACS compiled with
  MPI support, thus include the cmake
  options -DGMX_DOUBLE=ON -DGMX_MPI=ON -DGMX_MIMIC=ON

- Compile the MiMiC Communication Library in this archive following
  the following strategy:

cd MiMiCCommLib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_location> ..
make && make install
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<install_location>:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
cd ../..

- Download and expand the file cpmd-v4.1.tar.gz that you can download
  from the CPMD.org website after registering:

tar -xvzf cpmd-v4.1.tar.gz

- Copy the patch MiMiC_Patch_for_CPMD-4.1.txt in this archive to the
  folder CPMD:

cd CPMD
cp ../MiMiC_Patch_for_CPMD-4.1.txt .
patch -p1 < MiMiC_Patch_for_CPMD-4.1.txt

- In the folder “configure”, open the file MIMIC (if compiling with
  GCC compiler) or MIMIC_INTEL (if compiling with INTEL compiler) and
  adjust the paths for LIBS and FFLAGS in order to point to
  MimicCommLib and MiMiC build folders

- Compile CPMD by following the detailed instructions in the CPMD
  manual, or for a default compilation by executing the command:

./configure.sh MIMIC<_INTEL>
make

Add -omp to that command line if you want to use also OpenMP threads.

- After the compilation the executable will be named cpmd.x
