In order to compile CPMD with MiMiC interface (not released yet):

- Install GROMACS 2019 or later with MiMiC enabled features, as
  documented in the GROMACS installation guide. Building QM/MM-capable
  version requires double-precision version of GROMACS compiled with
  MPI support, thus include the cmake
  options -DGMX_DOUBLE=ON -DGMX_MPI=ON -DGMX_MIMIC=ON

- Compile the MiMiC Communication Library in this archive following
  the following strategy:

cd MiMiCCommLib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_location> ..
make && make install
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<install_location>:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
cd ../..

- Download and expand the file cpmd-v4.3.tar.gz that you can download
  from the CPMD.org website after registering:

tar -xvzf cpmd-v4.3.tar.gz

- Copy the patch MiMiC_Patch_for_CPMD-4.3.txt that will be found on the CPMD
  website (not released yet) or alternatively download the MiMiC interface when 
  will be released, whose information will be available on the CPMD website.

- In the folder “configure”, open the file MIMIC (if compiling with
  GCC compiler) or MIMIC_INTEL (if compiling with INTEL compiler) and
  adjust the paths for LIBS and FFLAGS in order to point to
  MimicCommLib and MiMiC build folders

- Compile CPMD by following the detailed instructions in the CPMD
  manual, or for a default compilation by executing the command:

./configure.sh MIMIC<_INTEL>
make

Add -omp to that command line if you want to use also OpenMP threads.

- After the compilation the executable will be named cpmd.x
