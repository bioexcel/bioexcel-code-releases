BioExcel has worked on a new QM/MM communication library called MiMiC.
Currently, it is intended to work with CPMD and GROMACS. BioExcel is
distributing it under the LGPL v2.1 license.

GROMACS is freely distributable, and is distributed alongside MiMiC by
BioExcel. The aspects of MiMiC that require changes to GROMACS have
been integrated with GROMACS 2019 and are available freely and openly
according to the GROMACS LGPL v2.1 license, and also in this BioExcel
release.

CPMD is owned by IBM and has a proprietary license, so cannot be
distributed by BioExcel. Instead, we distribute a patch to CPMD, which
is a derived work whose execution and distribution is permitted by the
terms of that license. Code fragments subject to the CPMD license do
appear in that patch, and these are not relicensed by
BioExcel. However the aspects of the patch developed by BioExcel are
distributed under the same license as MiMiC, ie. under the LGPL v2.1
license.
