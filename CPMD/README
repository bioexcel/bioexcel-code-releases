BioExcel has worked on the QM/MM library called MiMiC, so is
distributing it. It is intended to work with CPMD and GROMACS.
GROMACS is freely distributable, and is distributed alongside MiMiC by
BioExcel. However, CPMD cannot be distributed by BioExcel.

It should be noted that there is not yet any working version of QM/MM
supported by MiMic at the time the BioExcel release was made.
