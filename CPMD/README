This directory contains the first working version of the MiMiC
communication library, to be linked to both GROMACS and CPMD to
facilitate a QM/MM calculation. However, no released version of either
code yet supports such linking. The source code is found in
the src directory.

Building the library requires a C++11 compiler and cmake version 2.6
or higher. To build, run

cmake .
make
